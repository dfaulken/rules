# rules
DB-driven rule processing to transform source data into output data.

To initialize the database, run `models.py`.

To run the engine on any existing rules, run `engine.py`.

To run the tests, run `test.py`.

Uses `pipenv` and Python 3, so for me commands are `pipenv run python3 [FILENAME]`.
